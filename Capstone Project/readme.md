Technical Analysis:

In the real world, we frequently need to share our findings with other experts. In my Capstone project, I assembled a technical notebook that details the findings of my predictive model to share with my peers. It sis written in a language that satisfies technical stakeholders, providing complete documentation of my problem statement, approach, analysis, and source code. I explained some machine learning applications of my data. I used my model to display correlations, feature importance, and unexplained variance. I explained my research with a summary, reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of any variables in the process. Many modeling approaches are all about fine-tuning the algorithm parameters and trying to find a specific value. I showed how I optimized for this value, and the costs/benefits of doing so. I explained why I have chosen one or many feature(s) over others.I Identified what other data and/or features could help my model. Where applicable, I showed visualizations of my analysis, explaining the outliers and the relationships between the features/data. Goal: A technical Jupyter notebook that reviews and explains my model for technical stakeholders, including all necessary code and variables.

You can find my technical analysis on Capstone-Technical Analysis.ipynb (Python notebook) Assets folder has some figures that are added in my notebook
